# peshka.ml

This is the *old* source code for https://peshka.ml/

It's static HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I'm using jQuery, Materialize and ParticlesJS for the background. That's pretty much about it

So far there's only a single page - the homepage, which is a schedule for all my classes with the ability to filter and search, as well as highlight classes for today. It changes the background depending on the time of day.
